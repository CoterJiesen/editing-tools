        </p>
        <p>
            The various tools are grouped into six categories:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#settings">Settings</a></li>
                <li><a href="#editing">Editing</a></li>
                <li><a href="#proofing">Proofing</a></li>
                <li><a href="#finishing">Finishing</a></li>
                <li><a href="#boilerplate">Boilerplate</a></li>
                <li><a href="#searches">Search &amp; Replace</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <a name="settings"></a>
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>This is where you configure the the tool generally. There are three features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Version</b>: This tells you what version of the tool you are running. <a href="https://github.com/Perlkonig/editing-tools/releases">Visit the "Releases" section of the GitHub page</a> to download the latest version (or older versions, if you prefer).</li>
            <li><b>Help!</b>: This opens the help file you're reading now.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Settings</b>: There's currently only one setting you can change:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Edit-distance sensitivity</b>: This is used by the "Check Proper Nouns" feature (<a href="#proofing">see the "Proofing" section</a>). The number represents the number of changes you have to make to one word to make it another word. The higher the number, the more false positives you'll get. Too low and you'll miss valid misspellings. A setting of "2" seems to me to be a good balance, but play around with it if you wish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <a name="editing"></a>
        <h2>Editing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Apply Language</b>: Applies the selected language to all the text in the body, headers, footers, and notes. It does <em>not</em> find text in text boxes. I don't know if finds text in frames.</li>
            <li><b>Change Comment Owner</b>: This lets you change the name and initials of a comment owner. Only comments can be reassigned this way. Ownership of other revisions can only be done by altering the underlying XML files (very dangerous business). Either put your cursor in the comment you want to change or select the text containing the comments you wish to reasign. Then click the button. This <i>can</i> be undone (it takes two undos per comment changed).</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="proofing"></a>
        <h2>Proofing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Word List</b>: Creates a separate document containing all the unique words in the document. It retains capitalization. This is a great proofreading tool because it removes the meaning of the text and just gives you the individual words.</li>
            <li><b>Word Frequency List</b>: Does the same as above but also counts the occurences of each word. It puts the list in a table, which for some reason is slow, so please be patient.</li>
            <li><b>Check Proper Nouns</b>: This feature gets a lot of use in my day job. This tool generates a list of proper nouns (words that start with a capital letter and are not all-cap acronyms) and then does two comparisons: (1) a "sounds like" check and (2) an edit distance check (<a href="#settings">see the "Settings" section</a>). If it finds groups of proper nouns that are spelled differently but either sound alike or are close in spelling, it will list them in a new document. This is an excellent way to find common typos in proper names that can easily be missed in a long document.</li>
            <li><b>Phrase Frequency List</b>: Looks for phrases of the given lengths and produces a table listing each in frequency order. Good for finding overused phrases.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="finishing"></a>
        <h2>Finishing</h2>
        <p>This is for tools you run at the end of an editing pass.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accept Formatting Changes</b>: This lets you accept <em>all</em> tracked formatting changes with one click.</li>
            <li><b>Link Text</b>: I work sometimes on large documents where multiple instances of a document name is to be hyperlinked to the same destination. This tool lets you add, remove, or change a hyperlink on a specific string of characters, regardless of formatting.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="boilerplate"></a>
        <h2>Boilerplate</h2>
        <p>For me this is the second-most-used feature, next only to <a href="#proofing">"Check Proper Nouns."</a> If you find yourself typing similar comments over and over again, then this can save you tons of time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Apply Comment</b>: First select the text you want to comment on. Then select the short name of the comment you wish to insert. Then click the "Apply Comment" button. A new comment will be inserted containing the boilerplate. Edit as you will.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Manage Boilerplate</b>: This opens a new screen where you can manage your saved comments.
                <ul>
                    <li>To add a new comment, just start typing in the blank row at the bottom of the list.</li>
                    <li>To edit an existing comment, just click inside it and start editing.</li>
                    <li>To delete a comment, click in the small cell on the far left of the row so that the entire row is highlighted. Hit your Delete key.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Import/Export</b>: Use these buttons to back up or share your boilerplate.</li>
        </ul>

        <a name="searches"></a>
        <h2>Saved Searches</h2>
        <p>If you find yourself doing the same search over and over again, or just don't want to keep looking up that weird wildcard search everytime you need it, this feature could help.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Execute Search</b>: Simply select the saved search from the drop-down menu then click this button to execute it. It's not as full featured as the built-in Advanced Find dialog, but it's sufficient for most searches. If it doesn't work for a particular use case, let me know and I'll see what I can do.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Manage Searches</b>: This opens a new screen where you can manage your saved searcjes.
                <ul>
                    <li>To add a new search, just start typing in the blank row at the bottom of the list.</li>
                    <li>To edit an existing search, just click inside it and start editing.</li>
                    <li>To delete a search, click in the small cell on the far left of the row so that the entire row is highlighted. Hit your Delete key.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Import/Export</b>: Use these buttons to back up or share your saved searches.</li>
        </ul>
