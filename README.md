# editing-tools

These are just a couple tools I coded for use where I work. I can't guarantee that this code will work in your version of Visual Studio or Word. Microsoft does not make that sort of maintainability easy!

I'm just sharing this because a couple people asked for the code. If you find it useful, great!

If you just want to see the algorithms, then you'll be most interested in the files `Ribbon1.cs` (which contains the code that runs when you click a ribbon button and describes the overall algorithms) and `TextHelpers.cs` (which contains all the little helper functions that make writing the algorithms easier).

I'm happy to answer questions, and I'm always open to suggestions for improvement.

Good luck!

P.S. Do *not* confuse this with the most excellent ["Edit Tools" by wordsnSync](http://www.wordsnsync.com/). Also check out [PerfectIt](http://www.intelligentediting.com/).
